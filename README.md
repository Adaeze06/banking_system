# banking_system

## Project Directions:
Step 1: Download and install VSCode,  MySQL and then create a github repo for the project.  Be sure to commit and push your changes often throughout the project.  This will keep your code safe in case of local computer crashes!  Youâ€™ll also have a history of changes you made.
Step 2. Get familiar with SQL. Create a database in MySQL.
Step 3: Define data structure/table(s) for users and populate with data, at least one admin user and one customer.  
Step 4: Create all the functions that will be needed to handle the requests (make sure you utilize header files to organize your code) and create the tables needed for accounts data
Step 5: Create some sort of visual for the app. This can be a text-based, CLI menu, it can be a simple UI created in something like Tkinter, or it can be on a webpage using something like Flask
Step 6: Write tests for all the functions
